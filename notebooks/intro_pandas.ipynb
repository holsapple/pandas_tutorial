    "If you are new to Python, then this first step might seem strange to you. When you have Python installed on your computer, it comes with a standard library of code packages that are specialized to perform certain tasks more efficiently than if you were to write the code \"from scratch\" for every task you want to perform. In addition to the standard library, there are many other packages (a.k.a. modules) that are easily downloadable from the internet. Indeed, this is exacly what pandas is... a Python package used for data analysis that is not in Python's standard library.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has a small subset of [built-in functions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html) that are always available to you. However, if you want to use the functionality from one of those additional modules, whether they are from the standard library or downloaded from the internet, you must `import` it before you use it. As such, the first thing that most people like to do at the top of their code is to import the modules that they plan to use. If you forget one or simply decide later on to use one not already imported, then you can do so at any point in the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this next cell we `import` the modules necessary for this notebook. Some coders like to refer to this as a \"preamble,\" but I'm not sure that is standard. For reasons beyond the scope of this tutorial, it is also common for users to set certain parameters in the preamble. For example, below I set a few parameters that make the figures look a bit nicer. In addition to the imports and figure settings, there is also what we call a [magic command](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/magics.html): `%matplotlib inline`. This command simply tells the plotting module to produce the figures inline in the notebook."

    "So far we have done some very basic data exploration and plotting with a dataset we imported from a CSV file. There are many other file types that pandas can import data from, but Python also has the capability to download data directly from the internet. If you think about how you might download a file from the internet, you might wonder why one might want to write code that does the job. Afterall, all you have to do is navigate to a website that has the data you want and click a button. Then (depending on the size of the file) after a few seconds up to a few minutes the file is on your computer. You can move it to any directory you want and do whatever you want to do with the file... open it up in [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) to do a regression or import it into a Python script to do machine learning. But there are plenty of reasons you might want to automate the downloading process:\n",
    "1. You want/need to download many similar files and don't want to waste the time required to click and wait, which could take hours or days.\n",
    "2. The file size is so large that in order to do whatever you want to do with it would require you to load a prohibitively large file into the RAM on your personal computer, so you decide to work on a large remote computer.\n",
    "3. Perhaps the file size itself is not prohibitively large, but the analysis that you want/need to do with the data is incredibly time intensive and you don't want to tie up your personal computer for hours or days, so you want to use a remote computer.\n",
    "4. The data analysis you are doing involves using data that is regularly being updated online, so it makes more sense to automate the retrieval of the data.\n",

    "2. [NOAA's open data website](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/), which maintains vast amounts of global weather data at the National Climatic Data Center.\n",

    "4. [CDC's open data website](https://data.cdc.gov/), which houses more public health datasets than you could ever dream that existed.\n",

    "You might think the key to downloading data from the internet is simply knowing the URL of the webpage and writing a one-line Python command to get that data. But, it is a little bit more complicated than a one-line read/import statement. Moreover, it turns out that there is not a *one-size-fits-all* methodolgy for retrieving data online. The key to doing this is undstanding (at least at a surface level) how Python interacts with webpages to retrieve webpage information and convert it into human understandable/usable text, e.g., a CSV file."

This is common in programming. You can simply put the entire URL string on a single line, and to view it all you would simply scroll back-and-forth or change your font to be extrememly small. I don't like either of those options, so I write the URL string on two lines. In Python, when you write a single string across multiple lines, all you need to do is to place a `\\` character at each line break.\n",
    "2. The second thing you may (or may not) notice is the inclusion of parameter placeholder labels inside braces `{}` and following equal symbols `=`.

Tokens are not required with all data portals, but they are required for NOAA's website. For data portals that don't require them, if you request data without a token, the website will not prioritize your request. Long story short... you may wait a good bit of time until the website decides to start communicating with you. In fact, your request may even \"time out\" if the server is busy and you haven't provided a token. \n",

Python developers have created a very nice module that behaves (in many regards) much like the requests module in order to allow for simplified data retrieval from data sites that use SODA. It turns out that this Python SODA module actually makes use of the requests module in the background. Let's import the SODA module now, since it was not imported earlier."
