    "If you are new to Python, then this first step might seem strange to you. When you have Python installed on your computer, it comes with a standard library of code packages that are specialized to perform certain tasks more efficiently than if you were to write the code \"from scratch\" for every task you want to perform. In addition to the standard library, there are many other packages (a.k.a. modules) that are easily downloadable from the internet. Indeed, this is exacly what pandas is... a Python package used for data analysis that is not in Python's standard library.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has a small subset of [built-in functions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html) that are always available to you. However, if you want to use the functionality from one of those additional modules, whether they are from the standard library or downloaded from the internet, you must `import` it before you use it. As such, the first thing that most people like to do at the top of their code is to import the modules that they plan to use. If you forget one or simply decide later on to use one not already imported, then you can do so at any point in the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this next cell we `import` the modules necessary for this notebook. Some coders like to refer to this as a \"preamble,\" but I'm not sure that is standard. For reasons beyond the scope of this tutorial, it is also common for users to set certain parameters in the preamble. For example, below I set a few parameters that make the figures look a bit nicer. In addition to the imports and figure settings, there is also what we call a [magic command](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/magics.html): `%matplotlib inline`. This command simply tells the plotting module to produce the figures inline in the notebook."

One of the most widely used methods for storing data is in a file type called \"Comma Separated Values\" or CSV. A CSV file is simply a text file containing data. The name itself is kind of a misnomer, since the data in a CSV doesn't have to be separtated by a comma. It can be separated by a semicolon or tab or space or some other symbol, called a delimiter. As long as you know what the delimeter is, pandas will have no problem loading in the dataset. By default, pandas will assume the delimeter is a comma.\n",
